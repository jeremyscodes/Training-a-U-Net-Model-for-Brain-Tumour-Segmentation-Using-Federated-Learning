    "Our class `FlowerClient` defines how local training/evaluation will be performed and allows Flower to call the local training/evaluation through `fit` and `evaluate`. Each instance of `FlowerClient` represents a *single client* in our federated learning system. Federated learning systems have multiple clients (otherwise, there's not much to federate, is there?), so each client will be represented by its own instance of `FlowerClient`. If we have, for example, three clients in our workload, we'd have three instances of `FlowerClient`. Flower calls `FlowerClient.fit` on the respective instance when the server selects a particular client for training (and `FlowerClient.evaluate` for evaluation).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we want to simulate a federated learning system with 100 clients on a single machine. This means that the server and all 100 clients will live on a single machine and share resources such as CPU, GPU, and memory. Having 100 clients would mean having 100 instances of `FlowerClient` in memory. Doing this on a single machine can quickly exhaust the available memory resources, even if only a subset of these clients participates in a single round of federated learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the regular capabilities where server and clients run on multiple machines, Flower, therefore, provides special simulation capabilities that create `FlowerClient` instances only when they are actually necessary for training or evaluation. To enable the Flower framework to create clients when necessary, we need to implement a function called `client_fn` that creates a `FlowerClient` instance on demand. Flower calls `client_fn` whenever it needs an instance of one particular client to call `fit` or `evaluate` (those instances are usually discarded after use). Clients are identified by a client ID, or short `cid`. The `cid` can be used, for example, to load different local data partitions for each client"

The returned `client_fn` will be executed by Flower's VirtualClientEngine each time a new _virtual_ client (i.e. a client that is simulated in a Python process) needs to be spawn. When are virtual clients spawned? Each time the strategy samples them to do either `fit()` (i.e. train the global model on the local data of a particular client) or `evaluate()` (i.e. evaluate the global model on the validation set of a given client).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `partition_mnist()`: A utility function that downloads the MNIST dataset and partitions it into `NUM_CLIENT` disjoint sets. The resulting list of dataset partitions will be passed to `get_client_fn()` so a client can be constructed by passing it its corresponding dataset partition. There are multiple ways of partitioning a dataset, but in this example we keep things simple. For larger dataset, you might want to pre-partition your dataset before running your Flower experiment and, potentially, store these partition into your files system or a database. In this way, your `FlowerClient` objects can retrieve their data directly when doing either `fit()` or `evaluate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `weighted_average()`: This is an optional function to pass to the strategy. It will be executed after an evaluation round (i.e. when client run `evaluate()`) and will aggregate the metrics clients return. In this example, we use this function to compute the weighted average accuracy of clients doing `evaluate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `get_evaluate_fn()`: This is again a function that returns another function. The returned function will be executed by the strategy at the end of a `fit()` round and after a new global model has been obtained after aggregation. This is an optional argument for Flower strategies. In this example, we use the whole MNIST test set to perform this server-side evaluation."
